# Longevity stack

### Diet

A whole food plant based (WFPB) diet seems to be the best diet for preventing and reversing the most common age related diseases in humans such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. For examples, Bryan Johnson's [Blueprint](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/#step-1-meal-prep) and Greger's [Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.app.box.com/s/u4fsn7upyurc85tckg5p163xrvif297p/file/1051382381632) would both be great targets.

Caloric restriction and fasting are also shown to increase lifespan across animal models.

### Exercise

Cardio and strength training are both important to health and longevity. Strength training should not be neglected since we lose muscle with age. Strength improves healthspan and prevents injury which leads to faster decline.

### Supplements / Medications

When considering supplements and medications we must consider the effectiveness and the safety.

Effectiveness is best measured by significant reproducible results in animal trials, since we have limited mechanistic understanding of aging and no lifespan trials in humans. An explanation of the anti-aging mechanism, and that this mechanism is also present in humans, is also good - though must be read with skepticism due to our poor mechanistic understanding. The Interventions Testing Program (ITP) is the gold standard for reproducible lifespan trials, performing mice lifespan interventions in 3 separate labs and compiling the results.

Safety is best measured by long term usage in humans. Studies in animal models can also be helpful for evaluating safety - if they are living longer, it was safer for that animal to take it than not. A practical aspect of safety to keep in mind is also the purity of supplements - the supplement industry is unregulated and has very bad quality in some cases. Use a trusted brand with 3rd party lab tests like Nootropics Depot, Thorne, NOW.

There are 4 supplements / medications that have the most robust evidence of effectiveness and safety: rapamycin, acarbose, glycine and taurine. Rapamycin and acarbose demonstrate the strongest effect, while glycine and taurine show small but significant effect.

- Rapamycin
  - Background
    - Inhibits MTOR, and specifically MTORc1, a growth pathway. The most significant effect across animal models, with good safety data in humans. Thought to reduce aging by reducing growth - continuing growth post-adulthood could be a driver of aging.
  - Evidence
    - Multiple ITP trials all showing significant lifespan extension
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Rapa/C2009)
      - male: +10-22% median, +8% p90
      - female: +22% median, +21% p90
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension when combined with acarbose](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/RaAc/C2017):
      - male: +37% median / +24% p90
      - female: +28% median / +21% p90
    - [Evidence of anticancer effect in humans and FDA approval to treat cancer in humans.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2341)
  - Safety
    - Used and researched in human transplant patients at 2-5 mg daily dose. Used widely at 4+ mg weekly dose for anti-aging.
    - Most significant potential side effects are related to having kids.
      - For males: decrease in fertility. Seen in human transplant patients and high dose mice. In both humans and mice discontinuation of the drug allows fertility in all cases.
      - For females: [when taken during mice pregnancy, reduced size and growth of offspring](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28778941)
    - Can increase insulin resistance, raising blood glucose. This is likely why it synergizes with acarbose, which lowers blood glucose.
    - Can lower immune system response to bacteria. This can be an issue at high doses used in transplant patients but not reported in lower weekly antiaging usage. Recommend stopping usage while feeling sick.
- Acarbose
  - Background
    - Slows digestion of sugar, lowering blood sugar spikes. Taken with meals. Thought to reduce aging by reducing blood sugar spikes which can be harmful. Synergistic with rapamycin.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/ACA/C2013)
      - male: +17% median / + 11% p90
      - female: +5% median / +3% p90
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension when combined with rapamycin](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/RaAc/C2017):
      - male: +37% median / +24% p90
      - female: +28% median / +21% p90
  - Safety
    - Widely prescribed for type 2 diabetes. [Up to 300 mg 3 times daily.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493214/)
- Glycine
  - Background
    - Amino acid in food, a typical diet contains ~2 grams daily. Tastes sweet. One way it may help reduce aging is by being a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione. It may also depress methionine levels, with methionine associated with aging.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP Mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Gly/C2014)
      - male: +6% median / +5% p90
      - female: +4% median / +2% p90
    - When combined with NAC: 24% average mice lifespan extension. See NAC section.
    - [Glycine (7g) and NAC (9g) supplementation in older humans for 24 weeks improved some markers of health and increased glutathione](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ctm2.372)
  - Safety
    - Found in diet in similar amount as supplementation, so should be safe.
- Taurine
  - Background
    - Semi-essential amino acid, produced by the body and also found in food. Thought to extend lifespan by correcting for defeciency that occurs with age in humans and other animals. Vegans notably have lower levels of this since it is found mostly in animal foods, so vegans may have an extra benefit from supplementation of it. Neutral taste.
  - Evidence
    - [Main study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257). References:
      - Mice lifespan extension: median 10%. Equivalent human dose of 2.8-5.7g.
      - Lifespan extension in mice and worms
      - Improved health markers in monkeys (lifespan data pending as the monkeys have not yet died)
      - Blood concentration of taurine declines with age in mice, monkeys, and humans.
    - Non-vegetarians typically eat 40 â€“ 70 mg of taurine per day (Rana, 1986). Vegan diet has reduced amounts of taurine, with seaweed and soybeans as plant based sources. Vegans have been shown to have lower but normal blood levels of taurine (Laidlaw, 1988).
  - Safety
    - Found in diet and is an amino acid, so should be safe.
    - Improved health markers and lifespan in model animals as mentioned above

An honorable mention goes to N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC). When combined with glycine there is significant lifespan extension. However, it has not been evaluated in the ITP and in one study it increased lung cancer in mice. I think it is worth taking, but the evidence is not as clear cut as the previous supplements. 
- NAC (combined with glycine)
  - Background
    - This and glycine are precursors of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione. Antioxidant. Tastes terrible.
  - Evidence
    - [Single lab mice lifespan extension (male and female): ~24% average](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912885/)
      - Since this is a single study it needs replication, preferably by ITP, but the max lifespan was quite long so it is significant.
    - [Glycine (7g) and NAC (9g) supplementation in older humans for 24 weeks improved some markers of health and increased glutathione](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ctm2.372)
  - Safety
    - [NAC increased lung cancer metastasis in mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6795405/). There is some concern with antioxidants that since the prevent cell oxidation, this can actually protect cancer cells too. This seems somewhat at odds with the lifespan extension seen in mice, since mice mostly die of cancer.
   
Another honorable mention goes to carnosine, another amino acid. It has limited evidence but a good safety profile.
- Carnosine
  - Background
    - An amino acid produced by the body and consumed in food. A typical diet will contain ~250mg. Mainly found in animal foods, so could be additionally beneficial for vegans.
  - Evidence
    - [Single lab p50 +20% lifespan](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.1.1999.2.337)
    - Greg Fahy is a 73 year old researcher that looks great for his age and uses 1.5g carnosine/day. N-of-1 experiment that could just be good genes or other things. He theorizes it has a rejuvenating effect on the thymus.
  - Safety
    - Should be safe in similar-to-diet quantities since it is an amino acid found in common diets.

Others I think are interesting and have taken or considered taking:

- Creatine
  - Background
    - Improves strength and possibly cognition in humans, widely used. Creatine is found in lower levels in plant based diets so supplementing could have added benefit.
  - Evidence
    - [Improved leg strength and sit-to-stand exercise performance in elderly when supplemented with creatine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518405/)
  - Safety
    - Safe, widely used without negative effects.
- Astaxanthin
  - Background
    - Antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, pink pigment in salmon. 165g salmon has 3.6mg astaxanthin. 
  - Evidence
    -[ITP mice lifespan extension](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-01011-0)
      - 4000 ppm (3.5g / day human equivalent dose)
      - male: +12% median, +6% p90
      - female: no effect
  - Safety
    - Seems safe, given natural consumption and mice testing with much larger amounts. Note ITP tested a human equivalent 3.5g / day, but most supplements have only 12mg.
- Sulforaphane
  - Background
    - An ingredient of broccoli.
  - Evidence
    - Seems to have anticancer, other beneficial effects. [Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5225737/).
    - [Worm lifepsan extension]((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880325/)): ~15%
  - Safety
    - Seems safe.
- Glylo
  - Background
    - [Commercial supplement](https://juvifyhealth.com/pages/glylo) designed to reduce damage done by [glycation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation), so thought to reduce damage from high blood sugar.
  - Evidence 
    - [Single study mice lifespan extension]((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.10.503411v1.full)): +8% median / +5% max.
  - Safety
    - Seems safe.
- Lutein and Zeaxanthin
  - [Seems](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-much-lutein-per-day-for-macular-degeneration#lutein-and-macular-degeneration) to aid against age related macular degeneration.
- Berberine
- Vollagen (vegan collagen)
  - Collagen improves skin health and is just protein so is generally safe. Collagen is mostly glycine so glycine may be sufficient and can skip this.
- Hyaluronic acid
  - Improves skin health.
- Omega 3
- Vitamin D
- Ergothioneine
  - Antioxidant in mushrooms.
  - Extends lifespan in flies. ([study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877949/))
- Baikal Skullcap
  - Reduces glucose digestion via same mechanism as acarbose.
- White willow bark extract
    - Increased the average and maximum chronological lifespan of yeast by 475 percent and 369 percent, respectively. Titorenko says that's at least five times better than rapamycin or metformin, two drugs known for extending lifespan. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6791382/
    - Aspirin alternative and cheap
