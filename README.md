# Longevity stack

### Diet

I aspire towards a completely whole food plant based (WFPB) diet. This is the best diet for preventing and reversing the most common age related diseases in humans such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. For examples, Bryan Johnson's [Blueprint](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/#step-1-meal-prep) and Greger's [Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.app.box.com/s/u4fsn7upyurc85tckg5p163xrvif297p/file/1051382381632) would both be great targets. I actually eat a vegan, mostly WFPB diet.

TODO: Add research around why this is best.

### Supplements

I take and think everyone should take these:

- Rapamycin
  - Background
    - Inhibits MTOR, and specifically MTORc1, a growth pathway. By far the star molecule in longevity research today with a low risk and strong reward.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Rapa/C2009)
      - male: +10-22% median, +8% p90
      - female: +22% median, +21% p90
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension when combined with acarbose](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/RaAc/C2017):
      - male: +37% median / +24% p90
      - female: +28% median / +21% p90
    - [Evidence of anticancer effect in humans and FDA approval to treat cancer in humans.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2341)
  - Risks
    - Low risk. Used and researched in human transplant patients at 2-5 mg daily dose. Used widely at 4+ mg weekly dose for anti-aging.
    - Most significant potential side effects are related to having kids.
      - For males: decrease in fertility. Seen in human transplant patients and high dose mice. In both humans and mice discontinuation of the drug allows fertility in all cases.
      - For females: [when taken during mice pregnancy, reduced size and growth of offspring](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28778941)
    - Can increase insulin resistance, raising blood glucose. This is likely why it synergizes with acarbose, which lowers blood glucose.
    - Can lower immune system response to bacteria. This can be an issue at high doses used in transplant patients but not reported in lower weekly antiaging usage. Recommend stopping usage while feeling sick.
  - Dose
    - 4 mg once weekly. More is probably better.
- Acarbose
  - Background
    - Slows digestion of glucose, lowering blood sugar spikes. Taken with meals.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/ACA/C2013)
      - male: +17% median / + 11% p90
      - female: +5% median / +3% p90
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension when combined with rapamycin](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/RaAc/C2017):
      - male: +37% median / +24% p90
      - female: +28% median / +21% p90
  - Risks
    - Low risk, widely prescribed for type 2 diabetes.
  - Dose
    - 50 mg twice daily, with lunch and dinner
- Glycine
  - Background
    - Amino acid in food, a typical diet contains ~2 grams daily. Tastes sweet.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP Mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Gly/C2014)
      - male: +6% median / +5% p90
      - female: +4% median / +2% p90
    - When combined with NAC: 24% average mice lifespan extension. See NAC section.
    - [Glycine (7g) and NAC (9g) supplementation in older humans for 24 weeks improved some markers of health and increased glutathione](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ctm2.372)
  - Risk
    - Low risk, found in diet in similar amount as supplementation.
  - Dose
    - 4+ grams daily
- Taurine
  - Background
    - Semi-essential amino acid, produced endogenously and also found in food. Non-vegetarians typically eat 40 â€“ 70 mg of taurine per day (Rana, 1986). Vegan diet has reduced amounts of taurine, with seaweed and soybeans as plant based sources. Vegans have been shown to have lower but normal blood levels of taurine (Laidlaw, 1988). Neutral taste.
  - Evidence
    - [Mice lifespan extension](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257): median 10%. Equivalent human dose of 2.8-5.7g.
    - Same study as above: taurine deficiency associated with aging
  - Risk
    - Low, given fairly similar amounts are present in a typical diet.
  - Dose
    - 2-4+ grams daily
- B12
  - Background
    - A vitamin whose deficiency causes significant issues and is missing in vegan / plant based diets.
  - Dose
    - 1 mg, weekly
- Creatine
  - Background
    - Improves strength and possibly cognition in humans, widely used. Being strong is important in human lifespan due to loss of muscle with age and the risk of frailty. Creatine is found in lower levels in plant based diets.
  - Evidence
    - TODO
  - Risks
    - Low, widely used without negative effects.
  - Dose
    2.5-5g daily

Others I have taken or considered, but am not as sure about:
- NAC (combined with glycine)
  - Background
    - This and glycine are precursors of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione. Antioxidant. Tastes terrible.
  - Evidence
    - [Single lab mice lifespan extension (male and female): ~24% average](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912885/)
    - [Glycine (7g) and NAC (9g) supplementation in older humans for 24 weeks improved some markers of health and increased glutathione](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ctm2.372)
  - Risks
    - [NAC increased lung cancer metastasis in mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6795405/). There is some concern with antioxidants that since the prevent cell oxidation, this can actually protect cancer cells too. This seems somewhat at odds with the lifespan extension seen in mice, since mice mostly die of cancer.
  - Dose
    - 1+ grams daily
- Astaxanthin
  - Background
    - Antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, pink pigment in salmon. 165g salmon has 3.6mg astaxanthin. 
  - Evidence
    -[ITP mice lifespan extension](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-01011-0)
      - 4000 ppm (3.5g / day human equivalent dose)
      - male: +12% median, +6% p90
      - female: no effect
  - Risks
    - Seems low, given natural consumption and mice testing with much larger amounts.
  - Dose
    - ITP tested a human equivalent 3.5g / day, but most supplements have only 12mg.
- Sulforaphane
  - Background
    - An ingredient of broccoli.
  - Evidence
    - Seems to have anticancer, other beneficial effects. [Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5225737/).
    - [Worm lifepsan extension]((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880325/)): ~15%
  - Risks
    - Seems low.
  - Dose
    - ?
- Glylo
  - Background
    - [Commercial supplement](https://juvifyhealth.com/pages/glylo) designed to reduce damage done by [glycation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation), so thought to reduce damage from high blood sugar.
  - Evidence 
    - [Single study mice lifespan extension]((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.10.503411v1.full)): +8% median / +5% max.
  - Risks
    - Seems low.
  - Dose
    - 1 pill daily.
- Lutein and Zeaxanthin
  - [Seems](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-much-lutein-per-day-for-macular-degeneration#lutein-and-macular-degeneration) to aid against age related macular degeneration.
- Berberine
  - TODO
- Vollagen (vegan collagen)
  - Collagen improves skin health and is just protein so is generally safe. Collagen is mostly glycine so glycine may be sufficient and can skip this.
- Hyaluronic acid
  - Improves skin health.
- Omega 3
  - TODO
- Vitamin D
  - TODO
- Ergothioneine
  - Antioxidant in mushrooms.
  - Extends lifespan in flies. ([study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877949/))
- Baikal Skullcap
  - Reduces glucose digestion via same mechanism as acarbose.
