# Longevity stack

This describes my longevity stack, and my recommendations for others who would like to live healthier for longer.

### Diet

I aspire towards a completely whole food plant based (WFPB) diet. For examples, Bryan Johnson's [Blueprint](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/#step-1-meal-prep) and Greger's [Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/) would both be great targets. I actually eat a vegan, mostly WFPB diet.

TODO: Add research around why this is best.

- Lower saturated fat and cholesterol
  - Lowers cardiovascular disease, top cause of death for humans. Some studies of WFPB diet slowing and even reversing CVD.
- Methionine restriction
  - Plant based diets are lower in methionine. Methionine restriction seems to mimic the benefits of caloric restriction. It increases lifespan in [female flies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43550-2).
- Isoleucine restriction
  - A WFPB diet is lower in isoleucine, which [extends mice lifespan](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1).
- (Animal) protein restriction
  - Animal protein restriction seems to mimic the benfits of caloric restriction, likely in part due to methionine and isoleucine restriction and reduced MTOR and IGF-1.
- Fiber
  - TODO

### Exercise

Exercise most days. Biking, skiing, or kettlebell / pushups / pullups.

TODO: Add research around why exercise is good.

### Supplements

Main:
- Rapamycin
  - Background
    - Inhibits MTOR, and specifically MTORc1, a growth pathway.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Rapa/C2009)
      - male: +10-22% median, +8% p90
      - female: +22% median, +21% p90
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension when combined with acarbose](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/RaAc/C2017):
      - male: +37% median / +24% p90
      - female: +28% median / +21% p90
  - Risks
    - Used in humans for suppressing the immune system after transplants at 2-5 mg daily dose, establishing safety.
    - Most significant potential side effects are related to having kids.
      - For males: decrease in fertility. Seen in human transplant patients and high dose mice. In both humans and mice discontinuation of the drug allows fertility in all cases.
      - For females: when taken during mice pregnancy, bad effects in offspring.
    - May raise blood sugar, which may be why it is synergistic with acarbose.
  - Dose
    - 4 mg once weekly. More is probably better.
- Acarbose
  - Background
    - Slows digestion of glucose, lowering blood sugar spikes. Taken with meals.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/ACA/C2013)
      - male: +17% median / + 11% p90
      - female: +5% median / +3% p90
    - ITP mice lifespan extension when combined with rapamycin: see rapamycin section
  - Risks
    - Low risk, widely prescribed in humans.
  - Dose
    - 50 mg twice daily, with lunch and dinner
- Glycine
  - Background
    - Amino acid in food, a typical diet contains ~2 grams daily. Supplementation thought to be useful due to being a precursor of glutathione, along with NAC.
  - Evidence
    - [ITP Mice lifespan extension](https://phenome.jax.org/itp/surv/Gly/C2014)
      - male: +6% median / +5% p90
      - female: +4% median / +2% p90
  - Risk
    - Low risk, found in diet in similar amount as supplementation.
  - Dose
    - 4g daily
- NAC (combined with glycine)
  - Background
    - This and glycine are precursors of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione.
  - Evidence
    - Single lab mice lifespan extension (male and female): ~24% average ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912885/))
  - Risks
    - Some evidence that increasing antioxidant supplementation such as NAC can increase cancer risk. This is at odds with the lifespan extension seen in mice, which mostly die of cancer.
  - Dose
    - 1g daily
- Taurine
  - Background
    - Semi-essential amino acid, produced endogenously and also found in food. Non-vegetarians typically eat 40 â€“ 70 mg of taurine per day (Rana, 1986). Vegan diet has reduced amounts of taurine, with seaweed and soybeans as plant based sources. Vegans have been shown to have lower but normal blood levels of taurine (Laidlaw, 1988).
  - Evidence
    - [Mice lifespan extension](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257): median 10%. Equivalent human dose of 2.8-5.7g.
    - Same study as above: taurine deficiency associated with aging
  - Risk
    - Low, given fairly similar amounts are present in a typical diet. Since plant based diets are superior for lifespan it is possible the taurine deficiency is actually a good thing, and supplementing it is an error, but that seems unlikely.
  - Dose
    - 2g daily
- B12
  - Background
    - A vitamin whose deficiency causes significant issues and is missing in vegan / plant based diets.
  - Dose
    - 1 mg, weekly
- Creatine
  - Background
    - Improves strength and possibly cognition in humans, widely used. Found in meat, low levels in vegan diet.
  - Evidence
    - TODO
  - Risks
    - Low, widely used without negative effects.
  - Dose
    2.5-5g daily

Others:
- Astaxanthin
  - Background
    - Antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, pink pigment in salmon. 165g salmon has 3.6mg astaxanthin. 
  - Evidence
    -[ITP mice lifespan extension](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-01011-0)
      - 4000 ppm (3.5g / day human equivalent dose)
      - male: +12% median, +6% p90
      - female: no effect
  - Risks
    - Seems low, given natural consumption and mice testing with much larger amounts.
  - Dose
    - ITP tested a human equivalent 3.5g / day, but most supplements have only 12mg.
- Sulforaphane
  - Background
    - An ingredient of broccoli.
  - Evidence
    - Seems to have anticancer, other beneficial effects. [Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5225737/).
    - [Worm lifepsan extension]((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880325/)): ~15%
  - Risks
    - Seems low.
  - Dose
    - ?
- Glylo
  - Background
    - [Commercial supplement](https://juvifyhealth.com/pages/glylo) designed to reduce damage done by [glycation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation), so thought to reduce damage from high blood sugar.
  - Evidence 
    - [Single study mice lifespan extension]((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.10.503411v1.full)): +8% median / +5% max.
  - Risks
    - Seems low.
  - Dose
    - 1 tablet.
- Lutein and Zeaxanthin
  - [Seems](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-much-lutein-per-day-for-macular-degeneration#lutein-and-macular-degeneration) to aid against age related macular degeneration, which 23andme says I am at higher risk of.
- Vollagen (vegan collagen)
  - Collagen improves skin health and is just protein so is generally safe.
- Hyaluronic acid
  - Improves skin health.
- Omega 3
  - TODO
- Vitamin D
  - TODO
- Ergothioneine
  - Antioxidant in mushrooms.
  - Extends lifespan in flies. ([study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877949/))
- Baikal Skullcap
  - Seems to reduce glucose digestion via same mechanism as acarbose.

A note on supplements: non-pharmaceutical supplements are unregulated and the quality is bad. Buy from a trusted supplier with 3rd party lab tests like Nootropics Depot or Thorne.
