## Longevity stack:

### Diet

A largely whole food, plant based (vegan) diet.

### Exercise

Exercise most days. Generally biking, skiing, or kettlebell / pushups / pullups.

### Supplements

Main:
- Rapamycin
  - ITP mice lifespan extension (male): +22% median
    - When combined with Rapamycin: +37% median / +10% max
  - Inhibits a growth pathway called MTORc1.
- Acarbose
  - ITP mice lifespan extension (male): +16% median
    - When combined with Rapamycin: +37% median / +10% max
  - Delays digestion of glucose.
- Glycine
   - ITP Mice lifespan extension (male): +6% median / +5% 90%
   - Thought to be useful due to being a precursor of glutathione, along with NAC.
   - Amino acid in food, generally safe.
- NAC
   - Single lab mice lifespan extension (make and female): ~24% average ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912885/))
   - Thought to be useful due to being a precursor of glutathione, along with Glycine.
- Taurine
  - Single lab mice lifespan extension: 10%
  - Amino acid in food, generally safe. Lacking in plant based diets - possibly synergistic to fix deficiency, or detrimental because the deficiency is a good thing?
- B12
  - Necessary on a plant based diet.

Others:
- Sulforaphane
  - An ingredient of broccoli.
  - Worm lifepsan extension: ~15%. ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880325/))
  - Maybe beneficial for cancer?
- Glylo
  - Single study mice lifespan extension: +8% median / +5% max ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.10.503411v1.full))
  - Reduces sugar induced glycation
- Creatine
  - Improves strength in humans and seems safe. TODO: study on strength, why strength is good for longevity.
- Astaxanthin
  - Pigment in salmon, missing in plant based diet (though that could be a good thing). Antioxidant.
  - Unpublished ITP data: male lifespan extension.
  - Worm lifespan extension: +20%
  - [Rapamycin.news forum link](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/astaxanthin-a-potential-treatment-in-disease-and-aging-lifespan-increase/1183/6)
- Lutein and Zeaxanthin
  - [Seems](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-much-lutein-per-day-for-macular-degeneration#lutein-and-macular-degeneration) to aid against age related macular degeneration, which 23andme says I am at higher risk of.
- Vollagen (vegan collagen)
  - Collagen improves skin health, and is generally safe. Recommended by safety-conservative Stanfield.
- Hyaluronic acid
  - Improves skin health. Recommended by safety-conservative Stanfield.

ITP

The Interventions Testing Program is the gold standard of lifespan testing. It performs experiments at 3 different labs to reduce the chance of error. See the results [here](https://phenome.jax.org/projects/ITP1).
